# Application-of-Optimization-techniques-in-diabetes-prediction
The aim of this project is to present a detailed analysis of the comparison between base model,permutation feature selection and optimization algorithms in predicting diabetes
Firstly, the dataset is analyzed and the target class and attributes are identified. Then base model implementations of 4 models are done , SVM,KNN,Logistic regression and Random forest.
Then the results are compared to analyze the effect of pre processing.Then, permutation selection is applied to increase the performance and gain insights of the underlying relations between the attribute.
Finally, optimization algorithms are applied and the results are compared.
